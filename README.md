# Oslo-Code-Sample
This repository contains a sample of some of the codes I have worked on recently during my PhD research at CITA. Please see the readme for a breakdown of what is in this repository.

The codes in this repository are representative of a few proprietary codes that we have been using at CITA. I explain my contributions to each code in the following sections. We plan to make public versions of some of these codes in the next 6 months, but this work has not been completed yet, so I've done my best to explain the code structure of each subdirectory.
